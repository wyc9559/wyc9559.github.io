Hey! My name is Tong Wu. I am a PhD candidate at Helmholtz Zentrum München (HMGU). Currently, we mainly focus on the links between human blood metabolomics and the gut microbiome. Leveraging cutting-edge technology, we aim to determine key microbial-affected metabolites and link them to multiple host factors, including age, diet, and healthy condition. Specifically, we are interested in applying the links above to the Alzheimer’s disease case. Our ultimate goal is elaborate on the role of the hypothesis gut-liver-brain axis in Alzheimer’s disease cases.
